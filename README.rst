Originally Brushfire was a fork of Haystack_ designed to provide full
integration with Solr_ and access to all of its advanced features. I'm starting
this project over from scratch and I will pull desired features in from
Haystack_ as needed. I believe this is will be a faster means to a completed
project than trying to fork and modify the entirety of the Haystack_ core.

Where the goal of the Haystack_ project is to provide a modular search
infrastructure with a configurable set of search backends, the goal of
Brushfire is just the opposite. Brushfire is designed to allow access to all of
Solr_'s advanced featues at the expense of search server portability.
